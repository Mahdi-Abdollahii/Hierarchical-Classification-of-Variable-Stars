In this directory, I share datasets used in this work and some critical information. 

In this project, we use data from [OGLE Telescope](http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/) in Chile. This survey collected data in the I and V bands from stars in most parts of the milky way, LMC and SMC. Following figure shows its fooprint in sky.

For the first and second milestones, we used the OGLE_III datasets, and for the third ones, we used the OGLE_IV datasets. Both catalogs contain general information about variable stars and their magnitude time series data. Due to the huge amount of data, I could not upload them here. So you can download them by the below links from my google drive.

OGLE_IV   : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geFI1P_FKLm2HYrcdFVNNuKHpbNa1pza/view?usp=sharing 

For the second step, we need features to classify variable stars by traditional methods like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Classification (SVC). We used a package named [FEETS](https://feets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  for feature extraction and designed a table with selected features.

Do not hesitate if you have a question about datasets.
