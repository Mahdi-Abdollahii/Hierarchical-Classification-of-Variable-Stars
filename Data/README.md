In this directory, I share datasets used in this work and some critical information. 

For the first and second milestones, we used the OGLE_III datasets, and for the third ones, we used the OGLE_IV datasets. Both catalogs contain general information about variable stars and their magnitude time series data. Due to the huge amount of data, I could not upload them here. So you can download them by the below links from my google drive.

OGLE_IV   : https://drive.google.com/file/d/10dNHKQn2ubI8X7dYR98yfUKbSEahA44N/view?usp=sharing 

For the second step, we need features to classify variable stars by traditional methods like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Classification (SVC). We used a package named [FEETS](https://feets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  for feature extraction and designed a table with selected features.
