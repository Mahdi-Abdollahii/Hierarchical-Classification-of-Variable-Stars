In this directory, I share data used in this work and also some important information. 

For the first and second milestones, we OGLE_III datasets and for the third ones we use OGLE_IV. Both catalogues contain some general information about variable stars and their magnitude time series data.

Due to the huge amount of data, I share a link from my google drive for data related to the third milestone which we used Neural Networks. For each step, we explain how to use data in the report.
