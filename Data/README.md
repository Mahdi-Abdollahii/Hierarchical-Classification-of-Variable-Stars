In this directory, I share datasets used in this work and also some important information. 

For the first and second milestones, we used OGLE_III datasets and for the third ones we used OGLE_IV datasets. Both catalogues contain some general information about variable stars and their magnitude time series data. Due to the huge amount of data, I share links of two datasets from my google drive.
