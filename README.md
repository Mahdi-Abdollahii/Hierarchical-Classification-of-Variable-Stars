Here, I share the project had done for my master's degree. I continued this project and presented it as my thesis and it will be printed in the Iranian Journal of astronomy and astrophysics.

This project had several milestones which I share in separate directories:
  1 . Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
  2 . classification using traditional methods like RF, SVC, KNN
  3 . Classification Using Neural Networks
